# email-agent
My first project utilising the LangChain ecosystem exploring the usage of LangChain, LangGraph and LangSmith in order to make a smart email composer.

# Setup
The only things you need to change are two lines in the .env file, in order to add your own API keys for Google Gemini and LangSmith, denoted by YOUR_XXXX_API_KEY.

1. Run `uv sync`
2. Run `uv run [python file]`
3. Prompt some emails :)
